# AppSmashing
App Smashing for YU20CO22. Combing p5.js with GitHub to demonstrate the power creative coding.

At one point, students were just focused on solving the problems set up in front of them to accomplish the task.
In the last few years, students have been engaging in creative coding more and more to engage in programming/coding/computer science.

The reason I chose to appsmash P5.js and GitHub together is because version control is nothing without creative design and vice versa.

## The end in mind
### What do you want to make?

Anything! It can be a game, an app, art, but what I am looking for is to have student make an impact in their learning flow towards engaging with 21st century skills through specific set of tools that allow them to harness their creative and energy, or just find it, while they explore web development using JS/HTML/CSS and version control.

### How do you want to the students to show you what they know?

Ideation, planning, development, reflection. They are to share what they have made on the web and collect feedback in their issues to reflect up whether they move forward with their creation or not to allow them to gain insight from others on their entire process.

## Apps Smashed
### What apps do you know will help you create the product?
p5.js and its online web editor combined with GitHub.
I have used these two before to help get students engage in programming towards seeing how powerful coding/programming/CS can be.
P5.js is great to be able to get going fast and be able to create something meaningful in any context.
GitHub allows students to begin to connect with the tools they need to sustain a project.

## Smash workflow
### How will the apps go together?
Importing- with p5.js you can bring in any media and have it within your "sketch". The resource page is extremly handy.
GitHub takes a little time to get used to but it is relatively simple to import all sorts of media to have it stored.
Exporting- p5.js WebEditor can be used to share the sketch with others, you can also download the sketch to run locally.
GitHub requires, if you are comming from p5.js, copying and pasting the text into the web editor but over time students are encouraged to find  "more sustainable" ways to export from p5.js to GitHub. GitHub has github pages which hosts your app so that you can have others engage with it,

## Finished product
### How to share it with the world!
Using GitHub pages, students can share their work with others to get feedback on their work. The issues tab is a great way to collect feedback from people who visit the repository
